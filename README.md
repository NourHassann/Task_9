# Task_9
## Requirement
Design one or more PCBs for the Workshop competition system
- Add your Microcontroller such as (Arduino Nano,
STM32)
- Include Power inlet such as (power Jack,
rosetta)
- Interface with different motor driver(L298N)
and sensors (such as 9ultrasonic, IR, IMU),
using base data, or pin header
- Protect your circuit from (inverse current, short
circuit)
- (Bonus) Create SID to your system (include PCBs and
Wiring)
## Output
- Board files
- (.md) show your documents about this task
- (.pdf) Include SID for your system
