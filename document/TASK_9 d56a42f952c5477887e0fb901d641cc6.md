# TASK_9

---

this is detailed steps for PCB for competition workshop to control the ropot using stm32 and localize them by imu and ultrasonic and encoder

## the compountets

all compountets are from MIA lib 

- stm32

we get the analog and digital pin from this picture

- terminal block 4 pins

it used to simulate the place for the ultrsonic sensor and the encoder 

- terminal block 2 pins

it is the rossetta for the power

- terminal block 5 pins

it used to simulate the place of cytron motor driver

- MPU6050

## schematic design

we tried to make the schematic clear and simple by using net label instead of wire to make the process of tracing more easier 

the connection done with respect to the pinout for every component

## the PCB design

the * is used to label the components 

for the wire width was 0.245 mm 

we use via to join between two dots in the upper surface 

the connection is clear as hard as we can to made it easier in fabrication process 

## the drills final positions
